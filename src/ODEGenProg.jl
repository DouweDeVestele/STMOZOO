	fitness_test(tree::RuleNode, grammar::Grammar)
	
This is a hardcoded fitness function for the differential equation f'(x) - f(x) = 0, 
with boundary condition f(0) = 1. The expected solution is f(x) = exp(x). It returns the fitness 
for a given tree based on a given grammar. Inspired by Tsoulos and Lagaris (2006).

Comment: I implemented this function to make it more clear how the fitness for each expression derived from the expression tree is evaluated. 
This is based on evaluating the differential equation over an interval of sensible points. Also penalizes deviation from boundary conditions.
Weighted by factor 位 (here set to 100). I tested this for 5 different ODE's in the notebook. Some solutions are exact, others are more
approximations. The problem now it that I have a different fitness function for each differential equation, see also comment below".

	Standardize ODE form: the problem is that now I test 4-5 ODE in my notebook but each time have a seperate fitness function
	where I 'hardcoded' the system and boundary conditions. I guess it would be tidier if I have one function that could generate 
	a proper fitness function based on a standardized input of ODE f(x,y,y',y'',...) = 0 + boundary conditions.
